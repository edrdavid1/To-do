# Todo-App

This is a simple Todo application with a Node.js/Express backend and a vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS frontend.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete todo items
- Pagination for managing large lists of todos
- Cyberpunk-themed UI
- Dynamic weather and GIF panels
- Date and time display

## Setup

To get this project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ../todo-server # Assuming your backend is in a separate `todo-server` directory outside this project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd todo-app # Or wherever your frontend project is located, e.g., if you are already in the root of the frontend project, you don't need to cd.
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file:**
   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the `todo-app` directory. This file will store your environment variables.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Add the following lines to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder URLs with your actual backend server URL and Weather API Key:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/todos
   VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY
   VITE_WEATHER_CITY=YOUR_CITY_NAME # e.g., London, Moscow, New York
   ```
   *   `VITE_API_URL` is used in `src/api/todos.ts` to connect to your backend.
   *   `VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY` and `VITE_WEATHER_CITY` are used in `src/components/WeatherPanel.ts` for fetching weather data.

4. **Install dependencies (if any, though this project uses vanilla JS/HTML/CSS, you might have Vite or similar for development):**
   ```bash
   npm install # If you have a package.json
   ```

5. **Run the frontend application (if using a dev server like Vite):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   If you are just serving static files, you can open `index.html` directly in your browser or use a simple static file server.

## Usage

- Open your web browser and navigate to the address where the frontend is served (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` if using Vite development server).
- You can add new tasks, mark them as complete, edit their titles, and delete them.
- Navigate through pages using the pagination controls.
- Explore the additional panels for weather information, GIFs, and date/time.
